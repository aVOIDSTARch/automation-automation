# TOP LEVEL IDEAS

We will work here to determine what we think we are doing before we expand into depths.

## THREE CORE OBJECT TYPES

1. NODE
2. ACTION
3. RESOURCE


### NODES

- This is an interactive location that contains RESOURCES
- This can be a database, an API, a file-store, or another application, etc.

### ACTIONS

- These are /succinctly/ titled processes that can be called to interact with a NODE
- They are /simple/ or /fundamental/ behaviors that can be combined into complex activities
- Examples: WRITE [] TO {} or RETRIEVE [] FROM {}
